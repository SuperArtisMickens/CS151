/************************************************************************
 * Lecture 06: For Loops
 * This program will introduce you to the for loop. The for loop unlike
 * the while has a header that consists of an initialization section,
 * condition, and modification section. The for loop is used for looping
 * through sequences, ideally counting. The initialization section is 
 * used to either initial variables of the same data type or the 
 * assign values to variables that have already been declared. The 
 * modification section is used to assign new values to variables; it
 * is separate from the body of the for loop. The sections of the for 
 * loop header are separated by semicolons.
