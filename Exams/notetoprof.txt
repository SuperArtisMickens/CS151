Dear Professor,

I am glad that you are safe and well.
Thanks for being such an awesome professor.
I am writing because I had some difficulty with the exam this morning.
(1) I had some hardware issues this morning.
(2) I had a hard crash in the middle of writing my code.

I completed the exam, but, as you can probably guess its a little late (01:26pm EST).

Is there anything that can be done about this?

PLease let me know.

Thanks
